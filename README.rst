Can I combine bus and bike routes?
===================================

This is a repo for my idea that started at the Open Houston Hackathon. Google Maps will let you choose transit directions via public transit or bike, but I want to combine them.

Ideal Bike Map: From Open Houston
---------------------------------
Using the [Strava bike heatmap](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#12/-95.43815/29.76784/blue/bike) and existing bike lane maps, determine the ideal bike communiting patterns and recommend street changes to the City. Would be good to get [PWE](http://www.publicworks.houstontx.gov/home) on board & releasing datasets

I also wonder if I could combine the above data with bus data or Google Maps Transit data to create transit directions that COMBINE bike and bus routes?
